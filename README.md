# RecursiveFizzBuzzJS
A FizzBuzz program that operates recursively and doesn't only check if the input is divisible by 3 or 5, but by any number.
The array declared at the top is the value that will be printed to the console if the current number is divisible.
The denominator of the rational is the index of the element in the array + 1.

I.E. given the array [undefined, undefined, 'fizz', undefined, 'buzz'] the program would operated in the way you would expect of
a normal FizzBuzz program. This is because 'fizz' is at index 2, and thus for values divisble by (2 + 1) = 3 the program will print the vale of the element referenced by the index, 'fizz'.
